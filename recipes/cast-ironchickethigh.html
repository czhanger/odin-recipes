    <h4>Cast-Iron Thigh</h4>
    <p>Sophisticated enough for a Sunday supper yet quick enough for Wednesday's dinner, this master recipe is all in the technique. Cook the thighs skin side down in a cast-iron skillet to render out the fat and make the skin as crisp and, dare we say, delicious as bacon.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs (about 2 1/4 pounds)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 475Â°. Season chicken with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a 12" cast-iron or heavy nonstick skillet over high heat until hot but not smoking. Nestle chicken in skillet, skin side down, and cook 2 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-high; continue cooking skin side down, occasionally rearranging chicken thighs and rotating pan to evenly distribute heat, until fat renders and skin is golden brown, about 12 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer skillet to oven and cook 13 more minutes. Flip chicken; continue cooking until skin crisps and meat is cooked through, about 5 minutes longer. Transfer to a plate; let rest 5 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
