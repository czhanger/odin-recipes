    <h4>Bon Appetit Shrimp Scampi Recipe</h4>
    <p>Shrimp scampi is an ideal weeknight recipe: It comes together quickly with just a handful of ingredients, many of which you might already have in the house. The key here is, unsurprisingly, good shrimp. Unless you have access to a fishmonger, frozen wild-caught or frozen sustainably farmed shrimp are likely to be fresher than the frozen-then-thawed shrimp sitting on ice at your local supermarket.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 garlic cloves, 2 grated, 2 thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 pound large shrimp, peeled, deveined</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1/4 cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons chopped parsley</li>
        <li>warm crusty bread (for serving)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk grated garlic, salt, and 1 Tbsp. oil in a medium bowl. Add shrimp, toss to coat, and chill, uncovered, at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Heat remaining 2 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet over medium and cook shrimp mixture, being careful not to let shrimp or garlic brown, until shrimp is pink but still slightly underdone, about 1 minute per side. Transfer to a plate with a slotted spoon, leaving as much oil in pan as possible. Add sliced garlic and red pepper to skillet and cook, tossing, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add wine and lemon juice and cook, stirring occasionally, until reduced by half, about 2 minutes. Add butter and cook, stirring and swirling pan occasionally, until butter is melted and sauce is thickened, about 5 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Scrape shrimp along with any accumulated juices into skillet. Toss to coat and cook until shrimp are fully cooked through, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a platter, top with parsley, and serve with bread for dipping alongside.</li>
    </ol>
